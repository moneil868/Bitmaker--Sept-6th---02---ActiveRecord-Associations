# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Actor.create(name: "Dwayne Johnson", age: 48, skill: "Action Star")
# Show.create(name: "WWE wrestling", date: Time.now, time: Time.now, director_id: 1)
# Role.create(name: "The Rock", actor_id: 1, show_id: 1)
# Director.create(name: "Vince McMan")
